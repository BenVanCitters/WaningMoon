==========
This sketch is designed to run projections for a play called 'Waning' directed by Sophie Paterson.  Waning is Kamaria Harris' 2014 senior project and will be shown:

Thursday February, 6th at 8pm
Friday February, 7th at 8pm

The app itself uses an AKAI MIDI/USB controller and requires the following libraries to run:

'themidibus' library availble here: https://github.com/sparks/themidibus

GSVideo Library: http://sourceforge.net/p/gsvideo/code/HEAD/tree/

I should also mention that thus far it has been developed soley in Processing 1.5.1 and may not work in newer (or older) versions.
