==========
This sketch is designed to run projections for a play called 'Waning' directed by Sophie Paterson.  Waning is Kamaria Harris' 2014 senior project and will be shown:

Thursday February, 6th at 8pm
Friday February, 7th at 8pm
Saturday February, 8th at 2pm & 8pm


Libraries and other Requirements
================================
The app itself uses an Akai LPD8 MIDI/USB controller for most input

'themidibus' library availble from 'smallbutdigital' aka Severin Smith aka Sparky here: http://www.smallbutdigital.com/releases/themidibus/themidibus-latest.zip

GSVideo Library is available from Andres Colubri here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gsvideo/files/gsvideo/1.0/

I should also mention that thus far it has been developed soley in Processing 1.5.1 and may not work in newer (or older) versions.




==========
GSVideo is a more stable cross platform video library by Andres Colubri for Processing 1.5.1 than the video player that comes stock.  More details on 'GSVideo' can be found here: 
http://gsvideo.sourceforge.net/

Themidibus library is a project from 'smallbutdigital' aka Severin Smith aka Sparky which can be found here:

- I discovered this project while looking up how to use my Akai LPD8 controller with Processing through some code posted to openprocessing.org (http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/13161) by some apparently German Creative dev under the alias "Jay Silence".  Thanks 'Jay!  I owe the backbone of the input system in this project (and others) to you!
